<h3>Hello</h3>

<p>My name is Alberto Silva. I'm a christian, a husband, and a father. I live to create and learn. I'm currently working for HZDG in Rockville, Md as a designer/developer. I work closely with my peers and supervisors; refactoring, developing, and designing.</p>
<p>When I'm away from my computer you can find me in a pulpit, in the kitchen, at the local basketball courts, scaling a mountain, or loving on my family and friends.</p>
<p>This website serves as a portfolio and journal of things created and learned by yours truly. I can be reached at asilvadesigns@gmail.com and my resume may be downloaded here.</p>
