title: Computer Science is hard
---

It's all Google's fault really, this Foobar test is tough. However, it is thus far one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever.. experienced(deep words). If you don't know what Google Foobar is, a little Googling will get you straight. It seems to be a recruitment tool, or a cruel joke, fun nevertheless and makes you feel like a million bucks if you get an invite.

I'll have to make a detailed post about it soon enough, I'm just waiting until I get a bit further. It's essentially a code test, you go level by level, where level **n** has **n** challenges, up to level 5 in my case. You are presented with word problems, given an input and expected output, you choose Java or Python, and have whatever amount of time limit to solve it.

My problem is, I've never worked with data-structures or algoritms, not Java nor Python, and of course, no Computer Science degree. But when Google say's they've got a code challenge ready for you, you take it, because yes. It is a priviledge to do so, imo.

The journey thus far has been frustrating, brutal, and very humbling. I'm familar with software design patterns and fascinated with learning, these things have been invaluable. I nearly died at the end of the 2nd challenge, all 72 hours of the timed problem ate up my weekend. For future reference, never try to brute force a sorting algorithm, just don't.

Wonderful thing is, you can rest between challenges before requesting a new one, so I did. Took two weeks before starting the 3rd challenge, what a difference it made. I studied hard, and when I requested the problem, within the first 30 seconds I knew, this is a graph traversal problem. It was a peaceful weekend, and a rewarding experience. 

I'm now at the start of level 3, in which are 3 challenges. I'm spending much of my time on Khan Academy, MyCodeSchool, Gate Lectures, MIT OpenCourseWare, and various other resources. There are days I just feel stupid and want to cry. A few frustrating moments later, I understand and rejoice. Higher education is a wonderful thing, but the Internet is just as wonderful.

I hesitate to say God's grace has brought me thus far because what is block of code to the Almighty? Suppose I fail and don't make it to the interview phase, did the Lord fail? Or what if I do succeed, should I say it was His will, then do I preach a false Gospel that getting to Google is life's purpose. No. Hard is work is good, and wisdom is better.
