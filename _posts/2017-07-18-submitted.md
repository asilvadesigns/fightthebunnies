title: Submitted!
---

A couple of posts ago I wrote about my experience encountering the elusive
Google Foobar, and yet I have caught it on tape! Even better, somehow I was
able to pass level 3 and submit my solutions to a recruiter!

Submission occurred on July 4th, 2017. 

I'm not sure what this means, or if anything will happen. Honestly, I don't
think so, largely because I don't think I have enough skills just yet, the
materials isn't outside of my reach but my experience in Software Engineering
isn't what I think it should be. Perhaps they'll think otherwise and consider
giving me a shot at an interview.

For now, I'll wait. I did reach out to a recruiter on LinkedIn explaining the
whole thing. He was very nice and said he would pass on my information, I'm
very grateful for that. If something comes of it, I'll write about it, and give
the details, until then, I'm enjoying the new insights that studying Algorithms
and Data Structures has provided me. It certainly makes developing static sites
seem simple.
