title: Another redesign
---

This then is the first post of yet again, another redesign. However the focus will be a bit different. Considering the amount of time I spend coding and reading the Bible, there will be a mix of both. Sometimes serving as a journal or blog, other times as tutorial or reference. In either case it will be useful to actually start instead of just thinking about it.

An opportunity to redesign, for me, is often halted by choices of tech, type, and other things that don't really matter too much. I heard it said somewhere "you don't get paid to write code". True. But it's fun.

I just need this to be legible, somewhat organized, and pretty performant. Maybe some comments... maybe not. Jekyll plus Gulp equals let's go. Here's to fruitful blogging, Lord willing.
